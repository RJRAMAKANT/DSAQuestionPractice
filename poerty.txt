
Temple Twilight

The temple hushed as evening fell,
A soft glow touched each sacred bell.
And there she stood, a gentle bloom,
A pink kurti in the fading room.

Her smile, a sunrise, bright and bold,
A story in its light unfolded.
And in her eyes, a deeper gleam,
A whispered, unspoken dream.

A fleeting glance, a moment caught,
A sudden, unexpected thought,
A stirring deep, a feeling new,
A sense that something felt so true.

Then days spun by, and chance aligned,
Again her presence, softly kind.
No words were spoken, yet the air,
With silent thoughts, a burden bare.

Two souls connected, gaze to gaze,
A language spoken through the haze
Of unspoken feelings, soft and low,
A silent understanding seemed to grow.

And as the days began to turn,
A closer bond began to burn.
The temple's grace, a gentle start,
Revealed the beauty of her heart.

For in her presence, day by day,
A deeper loveliness held sway.
The outer charm, a sweet surprise,
But in her being, true beauty lies.



Temple Evening

The temple was quiet as day ended,
A soft light touched everything.
I saw a girl standing there,
Wearing a pink top, so fair.

Her smile was lovely, bright and clear,
And her eyes held something I could feel.
Just one look, and then I knew,
There was something special about her, it felt true.

A few days passed, and then again,
I saw her, like a happy sign.
We looked at each other, eye to eye,
And felt a special feeling go by.

Day after day, we got a bit near,
And I found out, it became clear,
That the beauty I saw from far away,
Was even more real, every single day.

She wasn't just pretty to see,
But her inside beauty shone out to me.
A simple meeting, a gentle start,
Revealed the goodness in her heart.
